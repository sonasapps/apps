# Hello There - Greeting Cards
Keep your cards forever

Built exclusively for iOS 16+, Hello There is the solution to *what to do with greeting cards from friends and family.*

Birthdays, Anniveraries, Holidays... the list goes on and on of occasions that we receive cards in the mail. So much thought and effort went into the sender picking out the perfect card, writing a special note, addressing, stamping, and mailing that letter to you. Unfortunately, more often than not, these cards end up in the trash and are soon forgotten.

Hello There lets you store these cards right on your iPhone and iPad. Cards are organized into folders by occasion, and contain images of the card, description text, and the date it was received. 

Utilizing the latest iOS 16 SDKs like Charts, Lock Screen Widgets, Live Text, and others, Hello There is the most advanced solution for keeping your cards with you at all times.
